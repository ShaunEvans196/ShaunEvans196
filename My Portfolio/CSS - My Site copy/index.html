      <h2>About Me.</h2>
      <p>Updated Sep 8, 2021 Wed.</p>
      <p>My name is Shaun Evans and I have been learning to make websites since the start of lockdown due to a change in role at work, shifting from a
        customer facing role, serving in the shop, to managing the online shop for the<a href="https://www.suttonrunner.com/"> Sutton Runner.com.</a /></p>
      <br>
      <p>It was in this role that my passion for websites and their design was realised. Through researching best
        practices, looking for ways to improve the website and increase turnover i found the desire to learn as much as i could and
        to understand the way it works together. This lead me to starting Udemy courses and creating my first HTML only website.
        This has only spiraled in to what can now be described as a passion to create the best websites that i can and be surrounded by likemindied people.</p>

        <h3>Udemy</h3>

        <h3>Websites I have worked on</h3>
        <img class="Work-Logo" src="images/SR logo.jpeg" alt="Sutton-Runner-Logo"></a>
        <p>The first website that I started to work on was the Sutton Runnner website. At this
           point in my development i was able to create product pages, create products and
           add images to the page. This was my first introduction in to website development.
           at this time i had a colligue that was able to show me what and how things worked on the wabsite.</p>
           <p>Here is a list of links so you can have a look at the websites tht i have worked on.</p>
           <ul class="mysites">
             <li><a href="https://www.suttonrunner.com/">SuttonRunner.com</a></li>
             <li><a href="/Users/shaunevans/Desktop/My Portfolio/Bike workshop  copy/homepage/index.html">Bike Shop App</a></li>
           </ul>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <h3>Personal Development.</h3>
        <p>Over time this website and the other pages that mke this site will become standalone projects of their own.</p>
        <p>Namely the one that i am spending the most time on at the moment will be a bike sercive web app that will aid bike mechanics
          too be more productive as it will handel admin, track work done to bikes and also create proffesional looking invoices.</p>
